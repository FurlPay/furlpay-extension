## Security model

- **No tokens in extension storage.** Auth is the furlpay.com session cookie (HttpOnly), sent
  automatically thanks to host permissions. Nothing to exfiltrate from `chrome.storage`.
- **Biometric approval happens on furlpay.com**, never in the extension: WebAuthn credentials are
  bound to the `furlpay.com` rpID and cannot be asserted from a `chrome-extension://` origin.
  The extension only deep-links to `/cards/approve` — this is what makes the flow phishing-proof.
- Declining a transaction (safe direction) is allowed in-extension via the session-authed API.
- Content scripts are observe-only, render in **closed shadow roots**, and never read page forms.
- Minimal permissions: `storage`, `notifications`, `sidePanel`, `alarms`, `activeTab`.
  Host permissions limited to `furlpay.com` + `localhost` (dev). No `scripting`, no `webRequest`,
  no clipboard.
- Message handlers validate `sender.id === browser.runtime.id`.

## Develop

```bash
npm install               # from repo root (workspace)
cd apps/extension
npm run dev               # live-reload Chrome build
npm run dev:firefox
```

Point the extension at a local backend from **Settings → Backend URL** (`http://localhost:3000`).
